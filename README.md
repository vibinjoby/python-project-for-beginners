## How to Run the Projects

### Prerequisites

To run these projects, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Running a Project

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-repo-url>.git
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific project folder and run the Python file for that project:
   ```bash
   python <project-name>.py
   ```

For example, to run the Dice Rolling Game:

```bash
python dice_rolling_game.py
```

## Optional Enhancements

Each project comes with a set of optional enhancements that allow you to further challenge yourself. These enhancements add more features and complexity to the basic versions of the projects.
